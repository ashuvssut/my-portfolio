This is my portfolio

This site is published at https://ashuvssut.github.io/my-portfolio/

This my first website that I created. Inspired by http://seanhalpin.io/. 

My website fits all (practical) screen sizes that you can ever imagine of. So you can say that my portfolio more responsive than the original Sean Halpin Website.

I tried to imitate all of the design and animations present in his portfolio. I wrote all the code myself to atleast nearly imitate his portfolio.


# Pending Tasks

1. Add some more animations to title section.
2. Work on the new Notes Tab.
3. Add a Showcase tab/ Work tab that opens up a page to showcase projects.
